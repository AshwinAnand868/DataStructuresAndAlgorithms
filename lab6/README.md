In this lab, I have to modify the working of a standard algorithm (here insertion sorting) to make it to sort the data more effeciently as compared to the regular insertion sort. This modified sorting uses the idea of heaps. I defined makeHeap(...) and heapfiy(...) function to support the functionality in lab6.cpp file.

After that, I gathered data by comparing the runtime for both the given algorithms and as expected modified version performed better. I have also created line graphs as per the collected data which can be seen in the wiki Lab 6 page.
